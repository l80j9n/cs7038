Question 1.
You, CPA, work for Dollar and Dollar CPAs. It is now March 15, 2024 and you have just finished meeting with Mr. Robins, a new personal tax return (T1) client of your firm. Mr. Robins is a 35-year-old resident of Canada who is married with 2 children. Additional information about your client is provided in Exhibit I.
Mr. Robins isn’t sure if he’ll be able to file his taxes on time, so he wants you to draft a memo to him describing and calculating an estimate of his minimum net income for tax purposes, taxable income and federal income tax owing for 2023. He will use this estimate to make sure his payment is made on time, as he doesn’t want to pay any interest or penalties. If any amounts received in the year are tax-free, then he wants you to tell him. Mr. Robins wants you to round your numbers to the nearest dollar. When is his 2023 income tax balance owing due?
Mr. Robins is also planning to start a new consulting business this year. He has provided you with a list of his expected income and expenses in Exhibit II. Based on the information provided in the exhibit, please explain (briefly) to Mr. Robins whether you recommend that he incorporate his business at this time, or whether he should operate as a sole proprietor. If he is a sole-proprietor in 2024, when is his 2024   tax return, and 2024   income tax balance owing, due?
Your client wants to minimize his 2023 taxable income and tax owing and wants to see all your detailed calculations. You can ignore HST/GST and provincial income tax. You do not need to calculate his spouse’s, or children’s, tax owing. You do not need to do any tax plannin代 写ADMS 3520 Overview of Canadian Income Tax Winter 2024 Assignment 2R
